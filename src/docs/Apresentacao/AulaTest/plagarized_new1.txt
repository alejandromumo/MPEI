The Army apologized for poorly managing the initial transition from CCAoA to GSA in 2014, and failing to do its due diligence to ensure GSA could handle the increased workload and administration of the program. “We deeply regret the hardships and inconvenience we caused our families and are doing everything possible to regain their confidence and ensure mission readiness for our families,” said Stephanie Hoehne, director of family and morale, welfare and recreation at the Army Installation Management Command.
